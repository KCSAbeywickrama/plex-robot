plese update 24th line as bellow of robot_controller.cpp to select a ball color.

int redBall = 1; //for red ball
int redBall = 0; //for blue ball

then clean & build

To compile & run our project, opencv lib(headers) need to be located in libraries folder & precompiled binaries need to be located in controller location. i.e. same sturcture of our PlexProject folder is needed.

So please copy "PlexProject\controllers\robot_controller" directory to the directory "controllers"
& copy "PlexProject\libraries\OpenCV452" directory to the directory "libraries"

Extract first and include all the STL files in the "CAD_files.zip" into the directory "world"
